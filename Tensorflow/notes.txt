Feature is the input information whereas Label is the output information we are looking for
We need data for AI/ML models

A tensor is a generalisation of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions. 
Internally TensorFlow represents tensors as n-dimensional arrays of base datatypes.

Types of tensors: except variable all are immutable
    -variable
    -constant
    -placeholder
    -sparsetensor

Slicing Tensors:
You may be familiar with the term "slice" in python and its use on lists, tuples etc. 
Well the slice operator can be used on tensors to select specific axes or elements.
When we slice or select elements from a tensor, we can use comma seperated values inside the 
set of square brackets. Each subsequent value refrences a different dimension of the tensor.
Ex: tensor[dim1, dim2, dim3]

The algorithms we will focus on include:
    Linear Regression
    Classification
    Clustering
    Hidden Markov Models

Linear Regression is one of the most basic forms of machine learning and is used to predict numeric values.
Linear regression follows a very simple concept. If data points are related linearly, we can generate a 
line of best fit for these points and use it to predict future values.

Line of best fit refers to a line through a scatter plot of data points 
that best expresses the relationship between those points

The training data is what we feed to the model so that it can develop and learn. 
It is usually a much larger size than the testing data.

The testing data is what we use to evaulate the model and see how well it is performing.

Feature Columns:
    Categorical: Our categorical data is anything that is not numeric! For example,
    the sex column does not use numbers, it uses the words "male" and "female".

    Numerical

For this specific model data is going to be streamed into it in small batches of 32. 
This means we will not feed the entire dataset to our model at once, but simply small batches of entries. 
We will feed these batches to our model multiple times according to the number of epochs.

An epoch is simply one stream of our entire dataset. 
The number of epochs we define is the amount of times our model will see the entire dataset. 
We use multiple epochs in hope that after seeing the same data multiple times the model will better determine how to estimate it.

The TensorFlow model we are going to use requires that the data we pass it comes in as a tf.data.Dataset object. 
This means we must create a input function that can convert our current pandas dataframe into that object.



Classification: Now that we've covered linear regression it is time to talk about classification. 
Where regression was used to predict a numeric value, classification is used to seperate 
data points into classes of different labels.
