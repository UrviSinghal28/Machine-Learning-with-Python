Feature is the input information whereas Label is the output information we are looking for
We need data for AI/ML models

A tensor is a generalisation of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions. 
Internally TensorFlow represents tensors as n-dimensional arrays of base datatypes.

Types of tensors: except variable all are immutable
    -variable
    -constant
    -placeholder
    -sparsetensor

Slicing Tensors:
You may be familiar with the term "slice" in python and its use on lists, tuples etc. 
Well the slice operator can be used on tensors to select specific axes or elements.
When we slice or select elements from a tensor, we can use comma seperated values inside the 
set of square brackets. Each subsequent value refrences a different dimension of the tensor.
Ex: tensor[dim1, dim2, dim3]

The algorithms we will focus on include:
    Linear Regression
    Classification
    Clustering
    Hidden Markov Models

Linear Regression is one of the most basic forms of machine learning and is used to predict numeric values.
Linear regression follows a very simple concept. If data points are related linearly, we can generate a 
line of best fit for these points and use it to predict future values.

Line of best fit refers to a line through a scatter plot of data points 
that best expresses the relationship between those points
