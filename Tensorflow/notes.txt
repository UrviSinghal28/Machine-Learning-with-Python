Feature is the input information whereas Label is the output information we are looking for
We need data for AI/ML models

A tensor is a generalisation of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions. 
Internally TensorFlow represents tensors as n-dimensional arrays of base datatypes.

Types of tensors: except variable all are immutable
    -variable
    -constant
    -placeholder
    -sparsetensor

Slicing Tensors:
You may be familiar with the term "slice" in python and its use on lists, tuples etc. 
Well the slice operator can be used on tensors to select specific axes or elements.
When we slice or select elements from a tensor, we can use comma seperated values inside the 
set of square brackets. Each subsequent value refrences a different dimension of the tensor.
Ex: tensor[dim1, dim2, dim3]
